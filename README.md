# H2-Computing-Notes
(My) **Codes** and **Notes** and **Past Year Papers** for _A Level H2 Computing_

Notes:
- Deleted past year school papers (you could probably find them on Holy Grail if you wanted)
- Deleted solutions provided by my jc (each jc has different standards so I only left my attempts)
- The extent of comments and explanation in files differs with how seriously I was doing the papers (whether I was appealing to the 6 marks coding standard or not) so some might have zero comments and others an excessive amount
- Will probably never touch this repo again since practical just ended :)
