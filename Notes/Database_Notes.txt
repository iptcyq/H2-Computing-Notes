Database: A collection of data stored in an organised or logical manner.

Relational database: Data is stored in relations and represented in the form of tuples 
Eg: TableName (Attrb 1, Attrb 2, Attrb 3), Student (ID, Name, Class)
relational db has 
-atomic values
-columns of the same kind
-unique rows
-order of columns insignificant
-columns have unique names

Record/ Tuple: A complete set of data on one item (row)
Field/ Attribute: A piece of data on one item (column)

Candidate Key: Minimum fields to make a record unique 
Primary Key: Candidate Key to make the main key
Secondary Key: Candidate Keys that are not PK
Composite Key: Multiple fields to make a record unique
Foreign Key: An attribute that refers to the PK of another table

Data redundancy: The same data being stored more than once
Eg: ID, Name, Class, Tutor; Class & Tutor is the same for multiple records
Possible issues:
-inserting data: cannot insert student till class and tutor assigned
-updating data: need to change all records of tutor when it changes
-deleting data: if student table is deleted, class and tutor info are deleted

Data dependency: 
Functional dependency: X as PK, and it uniquely determines Y
Eg: class (PK) and tutor (dependent on class)
Transitive dependency: Indirectly formed by 2 functional dependencies
Eg: X FD on Y, Y not FD on X, Y FD on Z - X TD on Z

Normalisation: Orgnaising tables to reduce data redundancy
